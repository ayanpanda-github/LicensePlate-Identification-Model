# LicensePlate-Identification-Model
Description: Program to detect number Plate from the running Vehicle  
# Proposed System
The presented approach is intended to identify license plates from moving objects. A
license plate image captured by a camera serves as the system's input, while its output—the
identification of characters on the license plate—occurs in a separate notepad window.
Estimation of vehicle speed, Image capture, License Plate Extraction, License Plate
Segmentation, and License Plate Recognition make up the system's typical six key modules for
an LPR system. Getting the image is the first task. The area containing the license plate is
extracted in the second task.
In a formal system, a variety of sensors, including video sensors, acoustic sensors, loop
detectors, ultrasonic sensors, and others, can be used to estimate the vehicle's speed. In this study,
footage captured by a security camera is used to determine the vehicle's speed and license plate
of the related car.
